<p>The safety, comfort and inclusion of every member of the group is extremely important to everyone at GEMS.</p>
<p>Everyone who comes to a meetup or participates in a GEMS-run event is expected to follow the following Code of Conduct:</p>

<h3>Behave Respectfully Towards Other Members</h3>
<p>We encourage all participants to exercise consideration and respect of their speech and actions. Be mindful of your surrounding and fellow participants. Whilst this is a casual setting, this is still technically a professional event and attendees should reflect that in their behaviour.</p>
<p>We do not tolerate unacceptable behaviour towards other members, guests, sponsors or staff in any form, including intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant.</p>
<p>Harassment includes: Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, age, ability, appearance, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, socioeconomic status or religion. Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing with photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<h3>Drink Responsibly</h3>
<p>Whilst the majority of GEMS events are dry, there may be exceptions for future venues where alcohol is available. We ask attendees to drink responsibly - Alcohol will not be accepted as an excuses for unacceptable/inappropriate behaviour.</p>

<h3>Photography/Filming</h3>
<p>You may take pictures and film at the event but if anyone asks you to not film them or their projects, please respect their wishes. To be safe, quickly asking someone beforehand is best!</p>

<h3>GEMS are here for you</h3>
<p>If you are made to feel uncomfortable or you experience unacceptable behaviour at or in an event or in the online community, please contact a member of the GEMS team via the Discord or email Alex at <a href="mailto:alexjohansson@hotmail.co.uk">alexjohansson@hotmail.co.uk</p>
<p>We reserve the right to take action to stop any unacceptable behaviour which may include expulsion from specific events or the online community. You may also be denied entry to future events. Please note that if you bring a new member along to the events, you will be responsible for their behaviour.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your participation in ensuring GEMS remains an inclusive and welcoming environment for all participants.</p>
