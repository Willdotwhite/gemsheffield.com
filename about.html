            <h3>What is GEMS?</h3>
            <p>We're a new meet up looking at creating an inclusive space in the city for folks to learn more about games, collaborate and explore what games can be as an artistic medium for everyone!</p>
            <p>GEMS stands for Games Experience Made in Sheffield, that can be anything from paper prototypes, escape rooms, board games, alternative controllers, digital games or completely new experiences!</p>
            <p>Feel free to bring anything along to show (or don't!)  As mentioned above, you don't have to work in games or even know anything about them, we want a group of folks that represents broader creative mediums and beyond - Illustrators, poets, writers, roboticists, gardeners, we want you all!</p>

            <h3>Where we meeting?</h3>
            <p>HYGGE is a lovely little coffee shop that's a 10 minute walk from the station, accessible by tram and 5 minutes walk from the bus interchange, so well connected! We have a wonderful little indoor garden space booked in the back where we'll have coffees and food.</p>
